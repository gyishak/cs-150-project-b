**Thesis Statement**: Due to the correlation between annual freshwater withdrawals and agricultural land in Asia,
those living in Asia must push lawmakers to make legislation that reduces the amount of freshwater used through methods like
irrigation management to create a safer environment for future generations. <br><br>
**Context**: Freshwater is an important substance for humans and wildlife and is vital for existence. 
But this essential substance is becoming scarce on our planet each year, especially in Asia. 
One of the reasons for this is agricultural production. According to World Wildlife, "Agriculture uses 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater, 
but some 60% of this is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems, inefficient application methods as well as the cultivation of crops 
that are too thirsty for the environment in which they are grown."<br><br>
**Who**: My audience is for those who live in Asia that are passionate about creating a safe space for our ecosystem as well as our future generation.
In terms of myself, I am a Computer Science student at Westmont College who has taken an interest in Environmental Justice. <br> <br>
**What**: <br> *Action*: One solution is irrigation management. According to the *World Wildlife Fund*, 60% of freshwater is being wasted by bad irrigation management. Farmers must fix this system in order to make sure that all the water is being used efficiently and is not wasteful. 
Another solution is staying educated on this topic in order to hold lawmakers accountable and push them to create legislation that keeps ecosystems protected and in mind. <br><br>
*Mechanism*: I will be using a live presentation to effectively communicate my data and the importance of it with my audience.
Having a live presentation will allow me to be in full control of how my data and analysis are presented.<br><br>
*Tone*: This is a very important topic and does affect many individual's jobs and lives so the tone I will be carrying is one of urgency. 
Because there are ways individuals can help this issue, I will be having a motivating tone when discussing solutions to prompt listeners to do their part in combating this issue.<br><br>
**How**: This is shown through three components. First is my choropleth graph that visually compares annual freshwater withdrawals 
and agricultural land. This will add to the narrative and story I am trying to convey as it shows a very clear correlation between the two
datasets. Second, my line and bar graph will be effective as it gives much more detail into individual countries through 2001-2021 if 
a user would like to learn more about their individual countries compared to others in the continent. <br><br>
This dashboard also incorporates presentation techniques like the avoidance of clutter. I tried to make my dashboard as minimal 
as possible so the data could stand for itself. Every aspect of the dashboard adds to the story even down to the theme of the dashboard 
(blue hues). Another reason I honed in on minimalism is so the listener can listen to my words instead of reading words on a screen 
that does not carry things like tone. The storytelling and presentation will be more effective this way.
<br><br>
**Data visualizing**: I will be using two data sets. The first is "Annual Freshwater Withdrawals (total % of internal resources)" 
in Asia from the years 2001-2021. The second dataset I will be using is "Agricultural land (% of land area)"
in Asia from the years 2001-2021.<br><br>
**Strategies to make visualization effective**: I will be using an interactive choropleth, line, and bar graph to display 
and demonstrate my thesis through this. The datasets will span from 2001-2021 specifically in Asia and display the percentage of annual freshwater withdrawals and agricultural land. <br><br>
